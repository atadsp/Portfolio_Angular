        	<h3> Synoh backed Hre and Uhannos </h3>
            <p> Synoh is the home planet of the species known as the Turan. Based in a science fiction world setting of my own design the dessert like world orbits around two red dwarf stars each with the mass just under half that of our Sun. Vegetation on the planet is black to better absorb the infrared radiation coming of the binary stars and water is silver toned due to large quantities of mercury in the oceans and lakes.</p>

            <p> Durhem is the name of a fantasy world of my own creation. Its surface is eighty percent covered by water with only three major continents on the surface. The largest continent shown here is known as Azure. </p>
