        	<h3> Synoh backed Hre and Uhannos </h3>
            <p> Synoh is the home planet of the species known as the Turan. Based in a science fiction world setting of my own design the dessert like world orbits around two red dwarf stars each with the mass just under half that of our Sun. Vegitation on the planet is black to better absorb the infrared raidation comming of the bianry stars and water is silver tonned due to large quanities of mercury in the oceans and lakes. </p>
